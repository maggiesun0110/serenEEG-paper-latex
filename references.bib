  abstract = {About 30\% to 40\% of the general population experiences insomnia symptoms of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, and another 10\% to 15\% of the general population experiences chronic insomnia disorder. The prevalence of insomnia is disproportionately higher in people with cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurocognitive disorders, including vascular cognitive impairment. In fact, recent meta-analytic evidence from epidemiological studies has demonstrated that insomnia, especially when accompanied by objective short sleep duration, is a risk factor for incident hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, stroke, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, and all-cause mortality. Insomnia should, thus, be part of the prevention and management of these adverse health outcomes. However, randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated whether treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, the first-line guideline-recommended treatment, or hypnotics/sedatives improves heart- or brain-related outcomes. Studies have also failed to consider insomnia a heterogeneous disorder consisting of distinct phenotypes that result from the relative contribution of biological versus cognitive-behavioral perpetuating factors. Objective short sleep duration has emerged as a marker of physiological hyperarousal in insomnia (ie, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, increased sympathetic nervous system activation, and increased inflammation), as a predictor of insomnia-related adverse heart and brain health outcomes and, potentially, poor response to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. This review summarizes the meta-analytic evidence on the association of insomnia with cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and neurocognitive disorders, including current knowledge on the heterogeneity of the disorder. This review also summarizes the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to heart and brain morbidity, which vary across insomnia phenotypes based on objective sleep duration. This review suggests that basic and clinical sciences need to unveil the molecular, cellular, and behavioral mechanisms at play across insomnia phenotypes, as the public health and clinical implications of their association with adverse heart and brain health are demanding immediate attention.}

  abstract = {Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1\%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7\%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p {$<$} 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen's kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.},

Nonetheless, user experience and factors which may interfere with the beneficial effects of neurofeedback are still under researched. This preliminary study aimed to investigate whether wearing an EEG neurofeedback recommended headset for 1 hour induced significant physical discomfort and fatigue. Data were obtained from a standard visual analogue scale questionnaire and a newly developed EEG headset discomfort (EEGhd) questionnaire. 21 participants (12 in the experimental (headset) and 9 in the control (electrodes only) group) watched a nature documentary video while their brain signals were recorded. They completed the set of questionnaires before and after the video, while wearing the EEG headset (or electrodes). A two-sample t-test revealed that the experimental group experienced significantly higher EEGhd than the controls (p {$<$} .001). Participants reported the onset of discomfort after approximately 25 minutes. These results highlight the importance of assessing user experience and accounting for physical discomfort when designing an EEG neurofeedback study.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) remains an essential method for monitoring brain activity, but the limitations of conventional systems due to the complexity of installation and lack of portability have led to the introduction and development of in-ear EEG technology. In-ear EEG is an emerging method of recording electrical activity in the brain and is an innovative concept that offers multiple advantages both from the point of view of the device itself, which is easily portable, and from the user's point of view, who is more comfortable with it, even in long-term use. One of the fundamental components of this type of device is the electrodes used to capture the EEG signal. This innovative method allows bioelectrical signals to be captured through electrodes integrated into an earpiece, offering significant advantages in terms of comfort, portability, and accessibility. Recent studies have demonstrated that in-ear EEG can record signals qualitatively comparable to scalp EEG, with an optimized signal-to-noise ratio and improved electrode stability. Furthermore, this review provides a comparative synthesis of performance parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), signal amplitude, and comfort, highlighting the strengths and limitations of in-ear EEG systems relative to conventional scalp EEG. This study also introduces a visual model outlining the stages of technological development for in-ear EEG, from initial research to clinical and commercial deployment. Particular attention is given to current innovations in electrode materials and design strategies aimed at balancing biocompatibility, signal fidelity, and anatomical adaptability. This article analyzes the evolution of EEG in the ear, briefly presents the comparative aspects of EEG---EEG in the ear from the perspective of the electrodes used, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using this new technology. It also discusses aspects related to the electrodes used in EEG in the ear: types of electrodes used in EEG in the ear, improvement of contact impedance, and adaptability to the anatomical variability of the ear canal. A comparative analysis of electrode performance in terms of signal quality, long-term stability, and compatibility with use in daily life was also performed. The integration of intra-auricular EEG in wearable devices opens new perspectives for clinical applications, including sleep monitoring, epilepsy diagnosis, and brain--computer interfaces. This study highlights the challenges and prospects in the development of in-ear EEG electrodes, with a focus on integration into wearable devices and the use of biocompatible materials to improve durability and enhance user comfort. Despite its considerable potential, the widespread deployment of in-ear EEG faces challenges such as anatomical variability of the ear canal, optimization of ergonomics, and reduction in motion artifacts. Future research aims to improve device design for long-term monitoring, integrate advanced signal processing algorithms, and explore applications in neurorehabilitation and early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Background Randomised sham-controlled trials of cranial electrostimulation with the Alpha-Stim Anxiety Insomnia and Depression (AID) device have reported improved anxiety and depression symptoms; however, no adequately powered sham-controlled trials in major depression are available. We investigated whether active Alpha-Stim AID is superior to sham Alpha-Stim AID in terms of clinical effectiveness for depression symptoms in major depression. Methods The Alpha-Stim-D trial was a multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, recruiting participants from 25 primary care centres in two regions in England, UK. Eligible participants were aged 16 years or older with a current diagnosis of primary major depression, a score of 10--19 on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and had been offered or prescribed and reported taking antidepressant medication for at least 6 weeks in the previous 3 months. Main exclusion criteria were contraindications to Alpha-Stim AID device use, having persistent suicidal ideation or self-harm, neurological conditions, a substance use disorder or dependence, an eating disorder, bipolar disorder, or non-affective psychosis, or receiving psychological treatment in the past 3 months. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1, minimised by region, anxiety disorder, and antidepressant use) to 1 h daily use of active (100 {$\mu$}A) or sham Alpha-Stim AID treatment for 8 weeks. Randomisation was via an independent web-based system, with participants, outcome assessors, and data analyst masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was change from baseline in score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17, GRID version) at 16 weeks after randomisation, with participants analysed by intention to treat (ITT; all randomly assigned participants). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN11853110); status completed. Findings Between Sept 8, 2020, and Jan 14, 2022, 236 eligible participants were randomly assigned to active or sham Alpha-Stim AID (n=118 each). 156 (66\%) participants were women, 77 (33\%) were men, and three (1\%) self-reported as other gender; 200 (85\%) were White British or Irish; and the mean age was 38{$\cdot$}0 years (SD 15{$\cdot$}3; range 16--83). 102 (86\%) participants in the active Alpha-Stim AID group and 98 (83\%) in the sham group were followed up 16 weeks after randomisation. In the ITT population, mean change in GRID-HDRS-17 at 16 weeks was --5{$\cdot$}9 (95\% CI --7{$\cdot$}1 to --4{$\cdot$}8) in the active Alpha-Stim AID group and --6{$\cdot$}5 (--7{$\cdot$}7 to --5{$\cdot$}4) in the sham group (mean change difference --0{$\cdot$}6 [95\% CI --1{$\cdot$}0 to 2{$\cdot$}2], p=0{$\cdot$}46). Among the 236 participants, 17 adverse events were reported in 17 (7\%) participants (nine [8\%] participants in the active Alpha-Stim AID group; and eight [7\%] participants in the sham group). One serious adverse event of suicidal ideation leading to hospitalisation was reported in the sham group, which was judged to be unrelated to the device. Interpretation Active Alpha-Stim AID was safe and acceptable, but no more clinically effective than sham Alpha-Stim AID in major depression.

  abstract = {Introduction Wearable in-ear electroencephalographic (EEG) devices hold significant promise for integrating brain monitoring technologies into real-life applications. However, despite the introduction of various in-ear EEG systems, there remains a necessity for validating these technologies against gold-standard, clinical-grade devices. This study aims to evaluate the signal quality of a newly developed mobile in-ear EEG device compared to a standard scalp EEG system among healthy volunteers during wakefulness and sleep. Methods The study evaluated an in-ear EEG device equipped with dry electrodes in a laboratory setting, recording a single bipolar EEG channel using a cross-ear electrode configuration. Thirty healthy participants were recorded simultaneously using the in-ear EEG device and a conventional EEG cap system with 64 wet electrodes. Based on two recording protocols, one during a resting state condition involving alternating eye opening and closure with a low degree of artifact contamination and another consisting of a daytime nap, several quality measures were used for a quantitative comparison including root mean square (RMS) analysis, artifact quantification, similarities of relative spectral power (RSP), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on alpha peak criteria, and cross-signal correlations of alpha activity during eyes-closed conditions and sleep activities. The statistical significance of our results was assessed through nonparametric permutation tests with False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. Results During the resting state, in-ear and scalp EEG signals exhibited similar fluctuations, characterized by comparable RMS values. However, intermittent signal alterations were noticed in the in-ear recordings during nap sessions, attributed to movements of the head and facial muscles. Spectral analysis indicated similar patterns between in-ear and scalp EEG, showing prominent peaks in the alpha range (8--12\,Hz) during rest and in the low-frequency range during naps (particularly in the theta range of 4--7\,Hz). Analysis of alpha wave characteristics during eye closures revealed smaller alpha wave amplitudes and slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in the in-ear EEG compared to scalp EEG. In around 80\% of cases, cross-correlation analysis between in-ear and scalp signals, using a contralateral bipolar montage of 64 scalp electrodes, revealed significant correlations with scalp EEG (p\,{$<$}\,0.01), particularly evident in the FT11-FT12 and T7-T8 electrode derivations. Conclusion Our findings support the feasibility of using in-ear EEG devices with dry-contact electrodes for brain activity monitoring, compared to a standard scalp EEG, notably for wakefulness and sleep uses. Although marginal signal degradation is associated with head and facial muscle contractions, the in-ear device offers promising applications for long-term EEG recordings, particularly in scenarios requiring enhanced comfort and user-friendliness.},

  abstract = {Insomnia was diagnosed by analyzing sleep stages obtained during polysomnography (PSG) recording. The state-of-the-art insomnia detection models that used physiological signals in PSG were successful in classification. However, the sleep stages of unbalanced data in small-time intervals were fed for classification in previous studies. This can be avoided by analyzing the insomnia detection structure in different frequency bands with artificially generated data from the existing one at the preprocessing and post-processing stages. Hence, the paper proposes a double-layered augmentation model using Modified Conventional Signal Augmentation (MCSA) and a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) to generate synthetic signals from raw EEG and synthetic data from extracted features, respectively, in creating training data. The presented work is independent of sleep stage scoring and provides double-layered data protection with the utility of augmentation methods. It is ideally suited for real-time detection using a single-channel EEG provides better mobility and comfort while recording. The work analyzes each augmentation layer's performance individually, and better accuracy was observed when merging both. It also evaluates the augmentation performance in various frequency bands, which are decomposed using discrete wavelet transform, and observed that the alpha band contributes more to detection. The classification is performed using Decision Tree (DT), Ensembled Bagged Decision Tree (EBDT), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), and Stacking classifier (SC), attaining the highest classification accuracy of 94\% using RF with a greater Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.97 compared to the existing works and is best suited for small datasets.},

  abstract = {Sleep is crucial for both the physical and mental well-being of human life. As the sleep pattern varies in every individual, it is essential to develop a methodology that enables us to detect sleep-related disorders precisely. Insomnia is one such disorder that affects humans mentally and physically. Signals from Polysomnograms (PSGs) are typically used to identify different sleep disorders. The PSG signals need a lot of handling time and are not patient-friendly. This work proposes to develop a method to automatically identify insomnia using single-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We have employed a Wavelet Scattering Network (WSN), a variant of deep convolutional networks, to extract features effectively WSN is an optimized network capable of learning features that assist in discriminating patterns concealed within signals. In addition, WSNs are insensitive to local disturbances, enhancing the network's dependability and efficiency. We have used single-channel EEG derivation, C4-A1, to create six separate subsets variants based on the sleep-stage annotations, developing the model individually and collectively for the wake, N1, N2, N3, and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep stages To build the proposed model, 12,576 epochs from the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) sleep database and 20,523 epochs from the Sleep Disorders Research Center (SDRC) dataset were considered. Our proposed model has attained the highest classification Accuracy (Acc) of 97\% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 using a Trilayered Neural Network (TNN) classifier considering the wake-sleep stage of the CAP database. Our devised method is straightforward and computationally efficient. Hence, it could be used for clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Objective. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability, comfort, and performance of a custom-fit, non-invasive long-term electrophysiologic headphone, known as Aware Hearable, for the ambulatory recording of brain activities. These recordings play a crucial role in diagnosing neurological disorders such as epilepsy and in studying neural dynamics during daily activities. Approach. The study uses commercial manufacturing processes common to the hearing aid industry, such as 3D scanning, computer-aided design modeling, and 3D printing. These processes enable the creation of the Aware Hearable with a personalized, custom-fit, thereby ensuring complete and consistent contact with the inner surfaces of the ear for high-quality data recordings. Additionally, the study employs a machine learning data analysis approach to validate the recordings produced by Aware Hearable, by comparing them to the gold standard intracranial electroencephalography recordings in epilepsy patients. Main results. The results indicate the potential of Aware Hearable to expedite the diagnosis of epilepsy by enabling extended periods of ambulatory recording. Significance. This offers significant reductions in burden to patients and their families. Furthermore, the device's utility may extend to a broader spectrum, making it suitable for other applications involving neurophysiological recordings in real-world settings.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Evidence from randomized clinical trials of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) for chronic insomnia disorder is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of taVNS for chronic insomnia compared with the sham taVNS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 2021 to December 2022 at a single center in Beijing, China. Patients with chronic insomnia disorder with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) of at least 8 were enrolled. Statistical analysis was performed from June to September 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were allocated to the active taVNS group or sham taVNS group with a 1:1 ratio. Both groups received the stimulation for 30 minutes each time, twice a day, 5 consecutive days a week, with an 8-week treatment and a 12-week follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the mean change from baseline through week 8 in PSQI scores. Minimal clinically important difference was 2.5 points. Secondary outcomes included mental health, sleepiness, and fatigue. Safety was also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 72 participants were randomized to either active taVNS group (36 participants; mean [SD] age, 45.2 [14.5] years; 27 [75.0\%] female) or the sham taVNS group (36 participants; mean [SD] age, 44.6 [13.9] years; 31 [86.1\%] female); 68 participants completed the 8-week intervention. The least-square mean changes from baseline to week 8 in PSQI were -8.2 (95\% CI, -9.3 to -7.0) points in the taVNS group and -3.9 (95\% CI, -5.1 to -2.7) points in the sham group. Both groups experienced statistically significant improvements from before to after the intervention. However, active taVNS showed a clinically meaningful 4.2-point greater reduction (95\% CI, -5.9 to -2.6 points; P\,{$<$}\,.001; Cohen d effect size, 1.2) in PSQI compared with the sham group (minimal clinically important difference\,=\,2.5 points). Secondary outcomes, including mental health and fatigue, showed similar favorable results. The efficacy of taVNS was sustained throughout the 20-week study period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, taVNS significantly reduced insomnia severity. Clinically meaningful enhancements in PSQI scores were observed compared with sham stimulation, with the benefits of taVNS sustained over a 20-week period. Future multicenter clinical trials with large sample sizes are needed to validate its effectiveness across diverse populations.

  abstract = {Insomnia disorder (ID) has become the second-most common mental disorder. Despite burgeoning evidence for increased high-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) activity and cortical hyperarousal in ID, the detailed spectral features of this disorder during wakefulness and different sleep stages remain unclear. Therefore, we adopted a meta-analytic approach to systematically assess existing evidence on EEG spectral features in ID. Hedges's g was calculated by 148 effect sizes from 24 studies involving 977 participants. Our results demonstrate that, throughout wakefulness and sleep, patients with ID exhibited increased beta band power, although such increases sometimes extended into neighboring frequency bands. Patients with ID also exhibited increased theta and gamma power during wakefulness, as well as increased alpha and sigma power during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, ID was associated with decreased delta power and increased theta, alpha, and sigma power during NREM sleep. The EEG measures of absolute and relative power have similar sensitivity in detecting spectral features of ID during wakefulness and REM sleep; however, relative power appeared to be a more sensitive biomarker during NREM sleep. Our study is the first statistics-based review to quantify EEG power spectra across stages of sleep and wakefulness in patients with ID.},
